# SCPSLAutosplitter

Settings in Livesplit needed (you can go in the code and change stuff if you want to customize): </br>
Split hotkey: F7 </br>
Stop hotkey: F6 </br>

You may want to set the start time to ~half a second as it takes a small amount of time by default for the program to check if you've started.

## FAQ/Troubleshooting
It's not detecting my start! : Go in and mess with the ranges, as well as the getpixel(x,y) values. It will have to be trial and error. </br>
The detection is too slow. : In the sleep() at the bottom of the page, lower the number. </br>
Have you ever heard the tragedy of Darth Plagius the Wise? : </br>
